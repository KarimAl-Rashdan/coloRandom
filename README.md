### Abstract:
[//]: <> 
  - We built a web application that generates a random color palette. The user can lock certain colors and create their own palette, which can then be saved in a seperate saved palettes section. Saved palettes can be added and deleted by the user. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
  1. Fork this repository.
  2. Clone your new, forked repo to your local machine.
  3. cd into the project's parent-level repository on your local machine.
  4. Open all files in your text editor.
  5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
  - We worked 4 hours for 5 days. This was our second group project and fourth overall project in the Front End software development program at Turing.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
  - Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
  - Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, creating and using an effective data model
  - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
  - Refine your collaboration skills

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
  - Win - Learning to use HTML data attributes to maintain synchronicity between the data model and the DOM.
  - Win - Worked collaboratively and maintained professionalism through GitHub pull requests, code review, and remote meetings.
  
  - Challenge - Syncing the data model with the DOM in regards to dynamic content. Independently researched and collaborated with peers to find a           workable solution.
  - Challenge - As we made changes to functionality in the JavaScript file, we had to continue to refactor and align the CSS and HTML.
